This is a collection of rather simple tools whose purpose is to try out
specific OpenCL features. Although it might be of assistance in checking
if specific implementations behave as expected in specific cases, it is
not aimed at that.

Currently the following tests are available:

overalloc-auto:
	check if it's possible to overcommit the memory of a compute
	device by allocating enough large buffers that not all of them
	may be physically present on the device at the same time. Kernels
	are launched in sequence to process the buffers in pairs, giving
	the platform the possibility to evict unusued buffers to make
	room for the ones in use.

overalloc-migrate:
	check if it's possible to overcommit the memory of a compute
	device by allocating enough large buffers that not all of them
	may be physically present on the device at the same time. The
	OpenCL 1.2 memobject migration feature is used to give hints to
	the platform on when it is feasible to migrate a buffer out of
	the device.

overalloc-migrate-copy:
	as above, but separate ‘host’ and ‘device’ buffers, and migrate
	‘host’ buffers to the host as soon as they are allocated, then
	during buffer use copy the current ‘host’ buffer to the
	appropriate ‘device’ buffer and use the ‘device’ buffer only in
	the kernel.
